This directory contains OSDaB ZIP 2007-02-01, as available on
http://osdab.42cows.org/snippets/zip.php.
Only minor changes were made to fit it into the MuseScore framework.

To support Unicode, several toAscii() and fromAscii() functions were
replaced by toUtf8() and fromUtf8() in filename and comment handling.
It is not clear if this change must be applied to password handling too.
