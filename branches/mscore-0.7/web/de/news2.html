      repository has changed from cvs to subversion.

         <li> configurable keyboard short cuts

      This release of MuseScore enables editing of
      crescendo/decrescendo symbols, simple lyrics and
      text objects like title, composer etc.
      Text properties can be edited by a new text style
      dialog. Printing now uses the native QT printing
      mechanism which has the ability to embed fonts
      in the postscript output so there is no need anymore to
      install the score fonts for printing.
