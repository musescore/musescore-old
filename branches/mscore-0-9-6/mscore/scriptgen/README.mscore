This code was generated with Qt Script Generator.
Qt Script Generator is a tool that generates Qt bindings for Qt Script. With the generated bindings you get 
access to substantial portions of the Qt API from within Qt Script and then MuseScore plugins.

Qt Script Generator is available for download here https://code.google.com/p/qtscriptgenerator/
The source code is here http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/qtscriptgenerator

Note: A few Linux distributions (Fedora,...) already package these bindings as a separate package.
