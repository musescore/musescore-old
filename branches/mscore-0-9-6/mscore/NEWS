Top new features

    * With the release of MuseScore 0.9.5 comes the first stable release for Mac OS X 10.4 and above
    * Create sound files of your scores via File → Save As... (WAV, OGG, and FLAC)
    * Use and create plugins
    * Know the pitch range of instruments (MuseScore marks out-of-range notes for amateurs in yellow and professionals in red)
    * Double-click to open a MuseScore file
    * Over 30 crashes fixed

Playback

    * Dynamic markings affect playback. For example ff sounds louder than mp
    * 8va and 8vb now affects a single staff (as expected) instead of all staves in a score
    * Tempo changes playback correctly for scores with repeats
    * All staves playback on Windows using the default
      SoundFont. Previous versions only played the top staff unless you manually setup a General MIDI SoundFont
    * Position of slider in play panel is now reliable
    * Mixer allows you to change instrument sounds on Windows. Linux versions could already do this
    * Individual notes can be microtuned up to 200 cents above or below the original pitch via the note/chord properties dialog. The Tuning plugin allows you to modify the pitch of all notes in a piece
    * Reworked internal fluid synthesizer
          o Reduced the idle load on the processor from ten percent to nearly zero percent. MuseScore only processes chorus and reverb if sound is present
          o Faster startup and smaller memory footprint especially when using large SoundFonts. MuseScore only loads samples from the SoundFont if needed

Files

    * Sets file type associations for MuseScore (".mscz" and ".mscx")
    * Drag-and-drop of files onto the MuseScore window opens the score on Windows (already available in Linux)
    * Automatically delete temporary files with names such "msHp4124" on Windows
    * New file extension ".mscx" replaces the old file extension ".msc". The old file extension conflicted with a type of Windows system file
    * Fixed problem with special characters (&<>\") in filenames for Compressed MuseScore Files
    * Part extraction is less prone to crashes (slurs, voltas, and bar lines through multiple staves are no longer a problem)
    * Export to sound file. See Export for more details on WAV, OGG, and FLAC
    * Improvements to MusicXML import: recognize text style, credits, meta-data, multi-measure rests, dominant chords
    * Improvements to MusicXML export: include information about page layout, credits, meta-data, multi-measure rests; fixed dominant chords, percussion clef, tempo markings, measure width, correct order for elements in note tag, correct octave for B sharps
    * Improvements to MIDI import: recognize key signature changes, copyright text
    * Improvements to LilyPond export: fixes for B, C, and C-sharp major key signatures
    * Implemented a preference that lets you apply a custom style file to all imported scores

User Interface

    * Close button appears on each tab similar to modern browsers instead of a single button off to the side
    * Default shortcuts conform to platform conventions. For example Ctrl+Y for redo on Windows, Ctrl+Shift+Z for redo on Debian/Ubuntu

    * Copy-paste of measures also includes chord names and lyrics
    * Copy-paste of full-measure rests
    * Note and rest split correctly across barline on paste
    * Note entry mode
          o Cursor now advances when you enter a rest

          o Backspace undoes the previously added note
          o Tuplet are created a little differently.
    * Undo now works for the following

          o Avoid touching other ledger lines when notes are close
