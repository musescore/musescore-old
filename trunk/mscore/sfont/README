sfconvert
=====================

Utility to compress sound font files with ogg vorbis.
The compressed file can be used directly with MuseScore.

Usage Example:
      sfconvert FluidR3.SF2 mops.sf3

This compresses the Fluid sound font from 148 MBytes to 20 MBytes.


The compressed sound font has the major version number 3. Its non standard
and can be used only (so far) by MuseScore.

TODO:
Stereo samples are compressed as two single streams instead of compressing
them as stereo ogg vorbis streams. This may be less optimal.
