22.Sep.2010:
      The files mscore-20.ttf is manually modified with fontforge.
      Do not create mscore-20.ttf with genFont script.
      Mscore-20.sfd is now considered the (fontforge) source of mscore-20.ttf


The code in this directory is from the Lilypond project modified to
suit the needs for MuseScore.

Changes:
      - added symbols: noteheads with stem and flags, for use in text and
        used to construct some icons

      - Separated the feta-alphabet into a separate font. Qt cannot handle
        symbols from the feta font in text context very well. The bounding boxes of
        single characters are too big (line spacing is derived from all symbols which
        makes no sense).
