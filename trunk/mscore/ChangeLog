        -> this breaks MusicXml import/export for slurs
      - changed implementation of grace notes: grace notes now have the

      _ extend time signature palette for custom time signatures
      - fix layout of instrument names
      - changed midi "divisor" from 384 ticks/quarter note to 480 to avoid

        from constant to variable is is now saved in the *.msc file.
      - Don't add a "generated" time signature to first staff in a score.
        Time signatures must always be explicit added. This allows for different
        symbols (example: "alla breve") for first time signature (or for no
        symbol at all)
19.12 (ws)
      * Changed TimeSig base class from Compound to Element.

      * removed object geometry calculation from SymbolPalette::setObject()
        (its already done in paintEvent())

        (bug resulted in first a-g key being ignored)
      * fixed crash on startup when .mscorePrj does not contain any loaded file
22.9 (ws)
      * removed pick/put mode of palettes. Only dragging of palette
