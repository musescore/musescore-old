        from constant to variable is is now saved in the *.msc file.
      - Don't add a "generated" time signature to first staff in a score.
        Time signatures must always be explicit added. This allows for different
        symbols (example: "alla breve") for first time signature (or for no
        symbol at all)
19.12 (ws)
