        not a "created" (from midi, etc) file.
      - measure number fixes: dragging no longer results in a duplicate object,
        you can no longer edit them, and the offsets are now saved

      - more flexible tuplet handling; its now possible to put
        notes/rests of different len in tuplets
      - change DurationType into class Duration and extent functionality;
        A chord/rest len is now described by a Duration() and a midi

        their main note
        -> this breaks MusicXml import/export for slurs
      - changed implementation of grace notes: grace notes now have the
        same tick position as their main note. This ensures that segments

        from constant to variable is is now saved in the *.msc file.
      - Don't add a "generated" time signature to first staff in a score.
        Time signatures must always be explicit added. This allows for different
        symbols (example: "alla breve") for first time signature (or for no
        symbol at all)
19.12 (ws)
      * Changed TimeSig base class from Compound to Element.
