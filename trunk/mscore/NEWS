Release 0.9.4 (svn):
      - New method to select unvisible elements covered by other elements:
        Press left mouse button to select topmost elements and then click right
        mouse button (while left mouse button is down) to cyclic select elements
        at the current mouse position.

      - You can now drop a symbol onto another symbol (called the base symbol).
        The dropped symbol is then anchored to the base symbol which means that its
        position is always relativ to the base symbol. In this was a symbol can
        be composed from different other symbols. If you move the base symbol, all
        other symbols anchored to this base symbol are also moving.

      - Extend functionality when pasting text in lyrics mode: only the first word
        ist pasted and removed from clipboard and then the cursor moves to next
        note/chord staying in lyrics mode.

      - New vertical spacer elements allow to adjust staff distance.

      - Use configured note stem directions in a multi voice context.

      - Added portmidi midi driver implements midi input for windows.

      - Canvas is now moved to follow playback.

      - Ties are now entered in a more natural way in note entry mode:
        Example: enter "g+g" to create two connected notes instead of "+gg"

      - Enhanced note entry mode:
        Example: when entering an 1/8 note at the place of an 1/4 note
        the 1/4 note is reduced to an 1/8 note to make room for the new note
        instead of first replacing the note with an 1/4 rest.

      - Selection and copy/paste is not restricted to measure boundaries any more.

      - As usual lots of bug fixes and some render enhancements.

            "S" again or leave note entry mode.
      - lots of bug fixes
