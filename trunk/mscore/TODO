Bugs:
      - rubber band selection (shift+drag)
            - does not select text properly
            - does not select bar lines at all

      - printing:
            - Printing is preferably done with a much higher resolution
              than screen display.
              This leads to different layouts for screen and print.
              Main reason is that qt gives different (slightly wrong)
              font metrics for different resolutions.

Features:
      - dotted rests
      - akkumulated empty measures
      - "Faulenzer Zeichen" (repeat symbols)
      + tuplets
      - rehearsal marks
      + system brackets
      + trill lines
      + ottava lines
            - shift pitch of bracketed notes while play
      - implement voice detection algorithm for midi import
      - allow insertion of arbitrary images
            - scale images
            - select anchor point
      - allow insertion of scalable vector graphics
      ...

Instruments
      - add General Midi program numbers to instruments
      - add usable/maximal pitch range
      - transposing instruments

Misc:
      - better handling of multi voice parts
      - optimize layouter, to speed up rendering
      - more drag/drop cut/paste operations

Page Preview in Page Settings:
      - add next/prev buttons for page selection

Navigation Panel:
      - handle case when score does not fit into
        panel (move panel content horizontally)
      - make panel resizable, or make size
        configurable

Player:
      - interpret tempo
      - interpret velocity; map velocity to musical symbols
        (pp-p-f-ff etc.)
      - interpret gate time (staccato etc.)
