Todo:
	- don't save Time values as enum values. Thats not portable/expandable
        and will break compatibility of xml files. Reuse code with musicXml save

	* better automatic beaming; grouping of notes should depend on time type
        (test example inv10.msc which has 9/8 time and should be grouped 3/8)
        (untested; only implemented for some types; breaks some demos)

Features:
      - allow for special musical symbols in text
            - palette popup in text edit mode to allow for
              selection of musical symbols
      - dotted rests
      - akkumulated empty measures
      - "Faulenzer Zeichen" (repeat symbols)
      - tuplets
      - rehearsal marks
      + system brackets
      + trill lines
      + octave lines
            - shift pitch of bracketed notes while play
      - implement voice detection algorithm for midi import
      - allow insertion of arbitrary images
            - scale images
            - select anchor point
      - allow insertion of scalable vector graphics
      ...

Instruments
      - add General Midi program numbers to instruments
      - add usable/maximal pitch range
      - transposing instruments

Misc:
      - better handling of multi voice parts
      - optimize layouter, to speed up rendering
      - more drag/drop cut/paste operations

Page Preview in Page Settings:
      - add next/prev buttons for page selection

Navigation Panel:
      - handle case when score does not fit into
        panel (move panel content horizontally)
      - make panel resizable, or make size
        configurable

Player:
      - interpret tempo
      - interpret velocity; map velocity to musical symbols 
        (pp-p-f-ff etc.)
      - interpret gate time (staccato etc.)
