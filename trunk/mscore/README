      MuseScore Score Typesetter
=================================================================

This is an early version of the Linux MusE Score Typesetter
"MuseScore".

MuseScore is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
Please check out the file COPYING in this directory for more
details.

Features:
      - WYSIWYG Design, notes are entered on a "virtual notepaper"
      - TrueType font(s) for printing & display allows for high quality
        scaling to all sizes
      - easy & fast note entry
      - MusicXML import/export
      - Midi (SMF) import/export
      - Midi input for note entry
      - integrated Fluid software synthesizer to play notes
      - direct print into pdf or postscript files

Requirements:
      - qt4 gui lib version qt4.1.x

        Note that many linux distributions split packages into a user
        and developer package and that you need to install both.

      - ALSA Version 1.0 or newer (midi input)
      - JACK audio server (audio output)
      - fluidsynth-1.0.0 and a decent sound font
      - gcc 3.4 or gcc 4.0
      - recommended: kde (MuseScore calls kprinter per default)
        If you dont have kde, please change the print command in
        "preferences".

Credits:
      MuseScore uses the "Emmentaler" font from the lilypond project.

Installation:
      - unpack source distribution
            tar xvofz mscore-x.x.x.tar.gz

      - configure
            (this only works if you are starting the next commands from X
             graphical user interface)

                  cd mscore-x.x.x
                  export QTDIR={path to your qt4 installation}
                  configure --prefix=/usr

            (if configure does not find the qt libraries you can enter something
            like:  configure --with-qt-prefix=/usr/lib/qt3
            which is reported to work with Mandrake)
            If you use gcc 3.4 compilation time can be reduced by a
            factor of three by using precompiled headers. For this
            configure with

                  configure --enable-pch
                  cd mscore
                  make allqt.h.gch

            (of course this should be autodetected by autoconf/automake but
             it unfortunately requires to be an expert for this tools)

      - make
            make

      - install as root user
            su -c "make install"

User Documentation:
      Currently there is not much documentation.
      I did some work on the framework which can be seen in the
      "de" (german) directory.

      Requirements:
            - tex with ConTeXt macro package
              (as part of tetex 3.0 distribution)

      Type "make doc" to generate man-de.pdf in doc/de.

Program Documentation:
      can be generated from source with DoxyGen;
      enter

            make dox

      Browse the documentation with your favourite html browser
      at:
            doc/html/index.html


Test:
      Enter
          mscore demos/promenade
      to see the demo file (Modeste Moussorgsky: Pictures of an
      exhibition: Promenade)

=================================================================
      Status
=================================================================

      MuseScore is in early alpha state. That means you should not use
      it for any real work. It is incomplete and probably buggy.
      The save format (*.msc) will most likely change in future
      versions.
