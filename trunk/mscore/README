      MuseScore Score Typesetter
=================================================================

This is an early version of the Linux MusE Score Typesetter
"MuseScore".

MuseScore is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
Please check out the file COPYING in this directory for more
details.

Features:
      - WYSIWYG Design, notes are entered on a "virtual notepaper"
      - TrueType font(s) for printing & display allows for high quality
        scaling to all sizes
      - easy & fast note entry
      - MusicXML import/export
      - Midi (SMF) import/export
      - Midi input for note entry
      - integrated Fluid software synthesizer to play notes
      - direct print into pdf or postscript files

Requirements:
      - qt4 gui lib version qt4.2.x

        Note that many linux distributions split packages into a user
        and developer package and that you need to install both.

      - ALSA Version 1.0 or newer (audio/midi input/output)
      - recommended: JACK audio server (audio output)
      - fluidsynth-1.0.0 and a decent sound font
      - gcc 3.4 or gcc 4.0 or newer
      - CMake 2.4

Credits:
      MuseScore uses the "Emmentaler" font from the lilypond project.

      - unpack source distribution

User Documentation:
      Currently there is not much documentation.
      I did some work on the framework which can be seen in the
      "de" (german) directory.

      Requirements:
            - TeX with ConTeXt macro package
              (as part of tetex 3.0 distribution)

      Type "make doc" to generate man-de.pdf in doc/de.

Program Documentation:
      can be generated from source with DoxyGen;
      enter

            make doxy

=================================================================
      Status
=================================================================

      MuseScore is in early alpha state. That means you should not use
      it for any real work. It is incomplete and probably buggy.
      The save format (*.msc files) will most likely change in future
      versions.
