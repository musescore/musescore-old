      MuseScore Score Typesetter
=================================================================

This is a developer version of the Linux MusE Score Typesetter
"MuseScore".

MuseScore is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
Please check out the file COPYING in this directory for more
details.

Features:
      - WYSIWYG Design, notes are entered on a "virtual notepaper"
      - TrueType font(s) for printing & display allows for high quality
        scaling to all sizes
      - easy & fast note entry
      - many editing functions
      - MusicXML import/export
      - Midi (SMF) import/export
      - Midi input for note entry
      - integrated sequencer and software synthesizer to
        play the score
      - print or create pdf files

Requirements:
      - qt4 gui lib version qt4.2.x

        Note that many linux distributions split packages into a user
        and developer package and that you need to install both.

      - ALSA Version 1.0 or newer (audio/midi input/output)
      - recommended: JACK audio server (audio output)
      - fluidsynth-1.0.0 and a decent sound font
      - CMake 2.4

Credits:
      MuseScore uses the "Emmentaler" font from the lilypond project.

Installation:
      - unpack source distribution
            tar xvofz mscore-x.x.x.tar.gz

      - configure
            cd mscore-x.x.x
            cmake .

      - make
            make

      - install as root user
            sudo make install

User Documentation:
      Currently there is not much documentation.
      I did some work on the framework which can be seen in the
      "de" (german) directory.

      Requirements:
            - TeX with ConTeXt macro package
              (as part of tetex 3.0 distribution)

      Type "make doc" to generate man-de.pdf in doc/de.

Program Documentation:

      Type "make doxy" to generate the program documentation with
      DoxyGen.

Test:
      Type "mscore demos/promenade"
      to start MuseScore with the demo file (Modeste Moussorgsky: Pictures of an
      exhibition: Promenade)

      Status
=================================================================

      MuseScore is in early beta state. That means you should not use
      it for any mission critical work. It is incomplete and surely has
      a lot of bugs. Also the save format (*.msc files) will most likely
      change in future versions.
