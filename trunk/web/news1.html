      <i>MuseScore</i> 0.7 arrived: For the first time there is a Windows
      version but currently without sequencer and synthesizer. The new
      Version has many new functions like insert and delete measures,
      a better layout, new score elements like changable note heads,
      rehearsal marks, tremolo, measure repeats etc.. The
      sequencer now can play repeats. As always there
      are also bugfixes and new bugs.
